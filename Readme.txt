The goal of this assignment was to convert a given SOP expression to its reduced form.
Task A is designed to convert any expression (both POS and SOP) to its canonical form.
The output from taskA.cpp is stored in a file output.txt.
Task B is designed specifically for reducing canonical SOP expression to reduced.
If the output.txt file contains only minterm expressions then the reduced form of
the minterms will get stored in outputB.txt.
The user can also give console input of the minterms to get output in console for
taskB.cpp
